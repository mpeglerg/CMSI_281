Classwork01 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

There is no file header.  You should have at least something!

There are TABS in this code.  Baaaaadddd...

Also, your repository structure is incorrect.  Please take a
look at the Assignment Submissions section of the week 01 web
page and make your structure look like that one.

You get 93% out of 100% on this.
