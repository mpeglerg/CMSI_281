Your repo is not structured correctly.  Please fix it!

You should have a "Homework" folder with folders under it
that are named for the homework assignments:

CMSI_281
   |
   +->  Homework
            |
            +->  Homework01
            |
            +->  Homework02

and so on, just like you have for your "Classwork" folder.

Thanks!

Dr. Johnson
